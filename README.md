# TrueRandomGenerator
This GitHub project focuses on implementing a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) based on a scientific article titled "GPUs and chaos: a new true random number generator" by Je Sen Teh, Azman Samsudin, Mishal Al-Mazrooie, and Amir Akhavan. The project aims to reproduce and further develop the idea presented in the article using CPU threads as the computing platform.

The project leverages the principles of chaos theory(chaotic maps) to generate truly random numbers.
